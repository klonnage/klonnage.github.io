## Résumé

Here is a short paragraph about me. I'm Vincent Bridonneau. I've started a Ph.D at Le Havre University since October 2020.
I'm a computer scientist and I work on Dynamic Graph theory as well as on High Performance Computing theory.

## Details

Here are some details about each task I achieved during my interns and my Ph.D

1. Pd.D in complex networks
   - Bibliography: mechanism at the origin of complex network properties such as scale-free or small-world.
   - Implemented model: a model based on Conway's game of life simulating network with dying nodes.
2. HPC instrumentation: my work consited in making sure that a code written using the MPI library will not produce deadlock at runtime. The code I have implemented is using C language.
3.
